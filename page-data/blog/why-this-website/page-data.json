Over the past decade, we’ve applied for dozens of visas across multiple countries - work visas, digital nomad visas, student visas, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>While we were successful in most cases, we experienced our fair share of rejections. These weren’t because we weren’t qualified, but because we misunderstood requirements, submitted incorrect documentation, or simply didn’t know the nuances of each country’s immigration system.</p>\n<p>One particularly frustrating experience in 2019 stands out. After spending weeks preparing our application for a specialized work visa, we were rejected because we had missed a crucial requirement buried deep in the official documentation. This rejection cost us time, money, and a great opportunity.</p>\n<h2>The Realization</h2>\n<p>After comparing notes with fellow travelers and expats, we realized we weren’t alone. The visa application process is notoriously opaque, and information is often:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scattered across multiple government websites</li>\n<li>Written in complex legal language</li>\n<li>Frequently updated without clear notifications</li>\n<li>Different for each country and visa type</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Our Solution: A Simple Q&#x26;A Approach</h2>\n<p>That’s when we had our lightbulb moment. What if we could create a website that simplifies the visa selection and application process through a straightforward question-answer format?</p>\n<p>Instead of forcing people to wade through dense documentation, our site asks simple questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“How long do you plan to stay?”</li>\n<li>“Will you be working while in the country?”</li>\n<li>“Do you have family members in the destination country?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on the answers, our system recommends the most appropriate visa type and provides a clear, step-by-step guide to the application process.</p>\n<h2>Why Our Approach Works</h2>\n<p>The beauty of our Q&#x26;A format is that it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cuts through complexity</strong> - No more legal jargon or hunting for information</li>\n<li><strong>Personalizes recommendations</strong> - Get visa suggestions based on your specific situation</li>\n<li><strong>Updates regularly</strong> - We stay on top of changing requirements so you don’t have to</li>\n<li><strong>Helps avoid common pitfalls</strong> - We highlight the mistakes we made so you don’t repeat them</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Real Impact</h2>\n<p>Since launching our site, we’ve helped thousands of travelers and expatriates successfully navigate visa applications. Our users report higher success rates and significantly less stress during the application process.</p>\n<p>One user recently told us: “After being rejected twice for my digital nomad visa, I used your site and got approved on my next try. The difference was knowing exactly what documentation I needed and how to present my case.”</p>\n<h2>Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>We continue to expand our coverage to more countries and visa types. Our mission is simple: make international mobility accessible to everyone by demystifying the visa process.</p>\n<p>If you’re planning to travel, work, or study abroad, we hope our site helps you avoid the headaches we experienced and makes your international dreams a reality.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why We Created a Visa Cheat Sheet: Our Journey","date":"March 15, 2025","description":"Our visa journey was sometimes long and confusing.
